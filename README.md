# Musical Drops
## WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge

Musical Drops is my submission for the WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge! It is designed to be an interactive music creation experience where you can experiment with creating different sounds using basic physics. Simple to use but difficult to master, Musical Drops offers a range of instruments and options to change timings and notes. 

Runs in Swift Playgrounds for iPad & Mac, or in Xcode 14 for Mac. Have fun!
